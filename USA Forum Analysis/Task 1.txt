A = load'/Consumer_Complaints.csv' using CSVLoader(',');
B = foreach A generate $15 as id,$13 as timely;
C = filter B by timely=='Yes';
D = foreach C generate id,timely;
E = group D by timely;
F = foreach E generate group,COUNT(D.id) as numofcomplaints;

store F into '/output/first' using PigStorage(',');

export into mysql:
